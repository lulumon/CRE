    <text>DTZ will be relocating its Chicago Brokerage Operation, Global Corporate Services and Facility Management teams along with all other related support functions from its current location at 161 N. Clark St. to the Central Loop location in March 2014.
 &#x201C;The new space and configuration will accommodate a 20 percent growth in capacity. DTZ has experienced significant growth across all business service lines in Chicago and globally, necessitating the need for this expanded footprint,&#x201D; said Greg Schementi, head of U.S. occupier services and brokerage.
 &#x201C;The 77 W. Wacker relocation will allow us to move to a new work environment that better supports our Chicago employees,&#x201D; said Christopher Wood, executive vice president and managing director of the Chicago office. &#x201C;It represents a tremendous opportunity to secure a new facility &#x2013; that as a sublease &#x2013; provides great value in one of the top quality buildings in downtown Chicago.&#x201D;
 DTZ was represented in sublease negotiations by DTZ Executive Vice Presidents Chris Wood and Todd Mintz and Vice President Kyle Harding. United was represented by Executive Vice President Molly Carroll and Senior Vice President Monica Moore of Jones Lang LaSalle. The Jones Lang LaSalle team continues to market an additional 130,750 square feet of sublease space on floors 11 through 17 on behalf of United.</text>
